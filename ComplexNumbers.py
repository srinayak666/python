#Python can also handle complex numbers and its associated functions using the file “cmath”.
# Complex numbers have their uses in many applications related to mathematics and python provides useful tools to handle and manipulate them.

#An complex number is represented by “ x + yi “.
# Python converts the real numbers x and y into complex using the function complex(x,y).
# The real part can be accessed using the function real() and imaginary part can be represented by imag().
