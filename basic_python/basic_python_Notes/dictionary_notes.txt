#Dictionary.
Dictionaries are collections of associated pairs of items where each pair consists of a key and a value.
This key-value pair is typically written as key:value.
Dictionaries are written as comma-delimited key:value pairs enclosed in curly braces.

We can manipulate a dictionary by accessing a value via its key or by adding another key-value pair.
The syntax for access looks much like a sequence access except that instead of using the index of the item we use the key value.
To add a new value is similar.

It is important to note that the dictionary is maintained in no particular order with respect to the
keys. The first pair added ('Utah': 'SaltLakeCity') was placed first in the dictionary
and the second pair added ('California': 'Sacramento') was placed last. The placement
of a key is dependent on the idea of “hashing”

Method Name             Use                     Explanation
keys                   my_dict.keys()           Returns the keys of the dictionary in a dict_keys object
values                 my_dict.values()         Returns the values of the dictionary in a dict_values object
items                  my_dict.items()          Returns the key-value pairs in a dict_items object
get                    my_dict.get(k)           Returns the value associated with 𝑘, None otherwise
get                    my_dict.get(k,alt)       Returns the value associated with 𝑘, 𝑎𝑙𝑡 otherwise
