-range produces a range object that represents a sequence of values.
-By using the list function, it is possible to see the value of the range object as a list.
refer: Range_Function.py

The range object represents a sequence of integers.
By default, it will start with 0.
If you provide more parameters, it will start and end at particular points and can even skip items.
In our first example, range(10), the sequence starts with 0 and goes up to but does not include 10.
In our second example, range(5, 10) starts at 5 and goes up to but not including 10.
range(5, 10, 2) performs similarly but skips by twos (again, 10 is not included).
