-The logical operators in Python are used to combine the true or false values of variables (or expressions) so you can figure out their resultant truth value.
-Three logical operators are available in Python:

1. and – returns True only if both operands are true.

In any other case, False will be returned.

For example, the following expression will evaluate to True: 5 < 7 and 5 > 3, because 5 is indeed less than 7 and greater than 3.
Here is the and operator’s truth table (a table that lists all the possible inputs and the results for the logical operators):

and operator’s truth table
First operand	Second operand	Result
True	                True	True
True	                False	False
False	                True	False
False	                False	False


Here are a couple of examples:

>>> 5 < 7 and 5 > 3
True
>>>
>>> 3 > 3 and 55 > 30
False
>>> 15 / 3 >= 200 and 3 == 3
False
>>> 55 == 55 and 3 <= 3
True


2. or – returns True when one or both of the operands are true.
 For example, the expression 5 < 3 or 3 == 3 will return True because the second operand (3 == 3) evaluates to True.
  Only if both operands are false will False be returned.
   The truth table for this operator looks like this:

or operator’s truth table
First operand	Second operand	Result
True                	True	True
True	                False	True
False	                True	True
False	                False	False


Examples:

>>> 3 == 3 or 5 < 3
True
>>> 15 < 3 or 5 > 3
True
>>> 12 <= 1 or 5 < 1
False
>>> 20 + 3 >= 23 or 5 != 5
True

3. not – negates the truth value of a single operand.
In other words, True becomes False and vice versa.
The truth table here is smaller because only a single operand is used:

not operator’s truth table
Operand	Result
True	False
False	True


Examples:

>>> not True
False
>>> not False
True
>>> not 5 > 3
False
>>> not (5 > 3 and 5 > 2)
False
>>> not (5 > 3 and 5 < 33)
False
>>> not (5 < 3 and 5 < 33)
True

Let’s expain the last example – not (5 < 3 and 5 < 33) – and why it returns True.
Simply evaluate the expression in the parentheses first:

5 < 3 – 5 isn’t smaller than 3, so this expression is false.
5 < 33 – 5 is smaller than 33, so this expression is true.

From the truth table for the and operator above, we know that False and True return False.
 So the expression 5 < 3 and 5 < 33 will return False.
 Now, we just need to apply the not operator, so False becomes True.
