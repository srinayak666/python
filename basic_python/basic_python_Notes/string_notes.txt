Strings are sequential collections of zero or more letters, numbers and other symbols.
We call these letters, numbers and other symbols characters.
Literal string values are differentiated from identifiers by using quotation marks (either single or double).

Method Name                   Use                               Explanation
center                     a_string.center(w)                   Returns a string centered in a field of size 𝑤
count                      a_string.count(item)                 Returns the number of occurrences of item in the string
ljust                      a_string.ljust(w)                    Returns a string left-justified in a field of size 𝑤
lower                      a_string.lower()                     Returns a string in all lowercase
rjust                      a_string.rjust(w)                    Returns a string right-justified in a field of size 𝑤
find                       a_string.find(item)                  Returns the index of the first occurrence of item
split                      a_string.split(s_char)               Splits a string into substrings at s_char


split will be very useful for processing data.
split will take a string and return a list of strings using the split character as a division point.
In the example, v is the division point.
If no division is specified, the split method looks for whitespace characters such as tab, newline and space.
#A major difference between lists and strings is that lists can be modified while strings cannot.
This is referred to as mutability. Lists are mutable; strings are immutable.
For example, you can change an item in a list by using indexing and assignment.
With a string that change is not allowed.
