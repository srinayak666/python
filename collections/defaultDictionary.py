The defaultdict works exactly like a python dictionary, except for it does not throw KeyError when you try to access a non-existent key.

Instead, it initializes the key with the element of the data type that you pass as an argument at the creation of defaultdict.
 The data type is called default_factory.

Import defaultdict
First, you have to import defaultdict from collections module before using it:


'''

from collections import defaultdict


'''
Create a defaultdict
You can create a defaultdict with the defaultdict() constructor. You have to specify a data type as an argument. Check the following code:



'''

nums = defaultdict(int)
nums['one'] = 1
nums['two'] = 2
print(nums['three']) #O/P: 0


'''

In this example, int is passed as the default_factory. 
Notice that you only pass int, not int().
 Next, the values are defined for the two keys, namely, 'one' and 'two', but in the next line we try to access a key that has not been defined yet.

In a normal dictionary, this will force a KeyError. 
But defaultdict initialize the new key with default_factory's default value which is 0 for int. 
Hence, when the program is executed, and 0 will be printed. 
This particular feature of initializing non-existent keys can be exploited in various situations.

For example, let's say you want the count of each name in a list of names given as "Mike, John, Mike, Anna, Mike, John, John, Mike, Mike, Britney, Smith, Anna, Smith".
'''

from collections import defaultdict

count = defaultdict(int)
names_list = "Mike John Mike Anna Mike John John Mike Mike Britney Smith Anna Smith".split()
for names in names_list:
    count[names] +=1
print(count)

#O/P: defaultdict(<class 'int'>, {'Mike': 5, 'John': 3, 'Anna': 2, 'Britney': 1, 'Smith': 2})

'''
First, we create a defaultdict with int as default_factory.
 The names_list includes a set of names which repeat several times. 
 The split() function returns a list from the given string. 
 It breaks the string whenever a white-space is encountered and returns words as elements of the list. 
 In the loop, each item in the list is added to the defaultdict named as count and initialized to 0 based on default_factory. 
 If the same element is encountered again, as loop continues, count of that element will be incremented.
