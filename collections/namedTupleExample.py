The namedtuple()
The namedtuple() returns a tuple with names for each position in the tuple. 
One of the biggest problems with ordinary tuples is that you have to remember the index of each field of a tuple object.
 This is obviously difficult. The namedtuple was introduced to solve this problem.

Import namedtuple
Before using namedtuple, you have to import it from the collections module.


'''

from collections import namedtuple

Student = namedtuple('Student', 'fname, lname, age')
s1 = Student('John', 'Clarke', '13')
print(s1.fname)#O/P: John
print(s1)#O/P: Student(fname='John', lname='Clarke', age='13')

'''
In this example, a namedtuple object Student has been declared. You can access the fields of any instance of a Student class by the defined field name.

Creating a namedtuple Using List
The namedtuple() function requires each value to be passed to it separately. 
Instead, you can use _make() to create a namedtuple instance with a list. Check the following code:

'''


s2 = Student._make(['Adam','joe','18'])
print(s2)#O/P: Student(fname='Adam', lname='joe', age='18')


'''

Create a New Instance Using Existing Instance
The _asdict() function can be used to create an OrderedDict instance from an existing instance.
'''

s2 = s1._asdict()
print(s2) #O/P: {'fname': 'John', 'lname': 'Clarke', 'age': '13'}


'''
Changing Field Values with _replace() Function
To change the value of a field of an instance, the _replace() function is used. 
Remember that, _replace() function creates a new instance. It does not change the value of existing instance.
'''
s2 = s1._replace(age='14')
print(s1)
print(s2)

#O/P
#Student(fname='John', lname='Clarke', age='13')
#Student(fname='John', lname='Clarke', age='14')
