'''
The deque
The deque is a list optimized for inserting and removing items.

Import the deque
You have to import deque class from collections module before using it.

'''

from collections import deque

'''
Creating a deque
You can create a deque with deque() constructor.
 You have to pass a list as an argument.

'''
list = ["a","b","c"]
deq = deque(list)
print(deq) #O/P: deque(['a', 'b', 'c'])

'''
Inserting Elements to deque
You can easily insert an element to the deq we created at either of the ends. 
To add an element to the right of the deque, you have to use append() method.

If you want to add an element to the start of the deque, you have to use appendleft() method.

'''

deq.append("d")
deq.appendleft("e")
print(deq) #O/P: deque(['e', 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd'])



'''
Removing Elements from the deque
Removing elements is similar to inserting elements. 
You can remove an element the similar way you insert elements. 
To remove an element from the right end, you can use pop() function and to remove an element from left, you can use popleft().

'''
deq.pop()
deq.popleft()
print(deq)
#O/P: deque(['a', 'b', 'c'])

'''
You can notice that both the first and last elements are removed from the deq.

Clearing a deque
If you want to remove all elements from a deque, you can use clear() function.


'''

list = ["a","b","c"]
deq = deque(list)
print(deq)
print(deq.clear()) #O/P: None


'''

You can see in the output, at first there is a queue with three elements. 
Once we applied clear() function, the deque is cleared and you see none in the output.

Counting Elements in a deque
If you want to find the count of a specific element, use count(x) function. 
You have to specify the element for which you need to find the count, as the argument.

'''

list = ["a","b","c","a"]
deq = deque(list)
print(deq.count("a")) #O/P: 2
