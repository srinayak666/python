-Counter is a subclass of dictionary object.
-The Counter() function in collections module takes an iterable or a mapping as the argument and returns a Dictionary. 
-In this dictionary, a key is an element in the iterable or the mapping and value is the number of times that element exists in the iterable or the mapping.
-You have to import the Counter class before you can create a counter instance.

from collections import Counter

Create Counter Objects
There are multiple ways to create counter objects. 
The simplest way is to use Counter() function without any arguments.
'''

cnt= Counter()

'''You can pass an iterable (list) to Counter() function to create a counter object.'''

list = [1,2,3,4,1,2,6,7,3,8,1]
cnt_=Counter(list)

'''
Finally, the Counter() function can take a dictionary as an argument. 
In this dictionary, the value of a key should be the 'count' of that key.
'''
_cnt=Counter({1:3,2:4})

list = [1,2,3,4,1,2,6,7,3,8,1,1]
cnt = Counter(list)
print(cnt[1]) #O/P: 4

'''
In the above examples, cnt is an object of Counter class which is a subclass of dict. 
So it has all the methods of dict class.

'''

'''
Apart from that, Counter has three additional functions:

Elements
Most_common([n])
Subtract([interable-or-mapping])
'''
'''
The element() Function
You can get the items of a Counter object with elements() function. 
It returns a list containing all the elements in the Counter object.
'''
cnt=Counter({1:3,2:4})
list_result=cnt.elements()
for i in list_result:
    print(i)

'''

Here, we create a Counter object with a dictionary as an argument. 
In this Counter object, count of 1 is 3 and count of 2 is 4. 
The elements() function is called using cnt object which returns an iterator which is passed as an argument to the list.

The iterator repeats 3 times over 1 returning three '1's, and repeats four times over 2 returning four '2's to the list.
 Finally, the list is printed using the print function.
'''

'''

The most_common() Function
The Counter() function returns a dictionary which is unordered. 
You can sort it according to the number of counts in each element using most_common() function of the Counter object.
'''
list = [1,2,3,4,1,2,6,7,3,8,1]
cnt = Counter(list)
print(cnt.most_common())
#O/P: [(1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 2), (4, 1), (6, 1), (7, 1), (8, 1)]

'''

You can see that most_common function returns a list, which is sorted based on the count of the elements. 
1 has a count of three, therefore it is the first element of the list.
'''

'''

The subtract() Function
The subtract() takes iterable (list) or a mapping (dictionary) as an argument and deducts elements count using that argument. 
Check the following example:

'''
cnt = Counter({1:3,2:4})
deduct = {1:1, 2:2}
cnt.subtract(deduct)
print(cnt)

#O/P: Counter({1: 2, 2: 2})

'''
You can notice that cnt object we first created, has a count of 3 for '1' and count of 4 for '2'. 
The deduct dictionary has the value '1' for key '1' and value '2' for key '2'. 
The subtract() function deducted 1 count from key '1' and 2 counts from key '2'.
