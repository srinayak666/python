The OrderedDict
OrderedDict is a dictionary where keys maintain the order in which they are inserted, which means if you change the value of a key later, it will not change the position of the key.

Import OrderedDict
To use OrderedDict you have to import it from the collections module.

'''


from collections import OrderedDict

'''
Create a OrderedDict
You can create an OrderedDict object with OrderedDict() constructor. 
In the following code, You create an OrderedDict without any arguments. 
After that some items are inserted into it.

'''

od = OrderedDict()
od['a'] = 1
od['b'] = 2
od['c'] = 3
print(od)
#O/P:OrderedDict([('a', 1), ('b', 2), ('c', 3)])



'''You can access each element using a loop as well. Take a look at the following code:'''

for key, value in od.items():
    print(key, value)

#O/P: a 1
     #b 2
     #c 3
     
     
'''

Following example is an interesting use case of OrderedDict with Counter. 
Here, we create a Counter from a list and insert element to an OrderedDict based on their count.

Most frequently occurring letter will be inserted as the first key and the least frequently occurring letter will be inserted as the last key.
'''
from collections import Counter
list = ["a","c","c","a","b","a","a","b","c"]
cnt = Counter(list)
od = OrderedDict(cnt.most_common())
for key, value in od.items():
    print(key, value)
    
    '''
    O/P:
a 4
c 3
b 2
