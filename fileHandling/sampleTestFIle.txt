It's possible to set - or reset - a file's position to a certain position, also called the offset.
To do this, we use the method seek. It has only one parameter in Python3 (no "whence" is available as in Python2). The parameter of seek determines the offset which we want to set the current position to. To work with seek, we will often need the method tell, which "tells" us the current position. When we have just opened a file, it will be zero. We will demonstrate the way of working with both seek and tell in the following example. You have to create a file called "buck_mulligan.txt" with the content "Stately, plump Buck Mulligan came from the stairhead, bearing a bowl of lather on which a mirror and a razor lay crossed.":
