#Resetting the Files Current Position

-It's possible to set - or reset - a file's position to a certain position, also called the offset.
-To do this, we use the method seek.
-It has only one parameter in Python3 (no "whence" is available as in Python2).
-The parameter of seek determines the offset which we want to set the current position to.
-To work with seek, we will often need the method tell, which "tells" us the current position.
-When we have just opened a file, it will be zero.
-We will demonstrate the way of working with both seek and tell in the following example.
