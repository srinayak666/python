#Write into a File

-Writing to a file is as easy as reading from a file.
-To open a file for writing we set the second parameter to "w" instead of "r".
-To actually write the data into this file, we use the method write() of the file handle object.

-Let's start with a very simple and straightforward example:

fh = open("example.txt", "w")
fh.write("To write or not to write\nthat is the question!\n")
fh.close()

-Especially if you are writing to a file, you should never forget to close the file handle again.
-Otherwise you will risk to end up in a non consistent state of your data.

-You will often find the with statement for reading and writing files.
-The advantage is that the file will be automatically closed after the indented block after the with has finished execution:

with open("example.txt", "w") as fh:
    fh.write("To write or not to write\nthat is the question!\n")

-Our ReadFile example can also be rewritten like this with the with statement:

with open("ad_lesbiam.txt") as fobj:
    for line in fobj:
        print(line.rstrip())

-Example for simultaneously reading and writing:

fobj_in = open("ad_lesbiam.txt")
fobj_out = open("ad_lesbiam2.txt","w")
i = 1
for line in fobj_in:
    print(line.rstrip())
    fobj_out.write(str(i) + ": " + line)
    i = i + 1
fobj_in.close()
fobj_out.close()

-If you want to append something to an existing file, you have to use "a" instead of "w".
