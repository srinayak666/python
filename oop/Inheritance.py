'''
In the above program, we created two classes i.e. Bird (parent class) and Penguin (child class). 
The child class inherits the functions of parent class. 
We can see this from swim() method. Again, the child class modified the behavior of parent class.
We can see this from whoisThis() method.
 Furthermore, we extend the functions of parent class, by creating a new run() method.

Additionally, we use super() function before __init__() method. 
This is because we want to pull the content of __init__() method from the parent class into the child class.'''
